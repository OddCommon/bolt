# Codename: ⚡️🤖 Bolt

A light weight way to make your html faster ⚡️

Demo: https://hungry-hoover-153767.netlify.app/examples/

## 🧐 What it does and WHY yet another router?

The primary goal of Bolt is to be an un-opinionated helper that speeds up page load times and gives users the feel of an SPA while remaining static HTML. It's not quite a router and not quite a transition library, it's main objective is speed and progressive enhancement, it's up to you to decide how to implement.

You can use Bolt in a few different ways, out of the box it will improve load times with a few modifications to your code.

Heavily inspired by [Quicklink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink), [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) & [Highway](https://highway.js.org/) the goal of Bolt is to be an easy to integrate script that gives speed + flexibility to build around.

## 📦 Setup

TBD Steps to install

## Dev

- `npm run dev`
- http://localhost:8000/examples

### 🔨 Router Wrapper

In order for Bolt to know where updates need to be rendered you need to specify a dom element to use. This is done by adding `data-bolt` to any top level DOM element that will be changing from page to page. Typically this would be your main content.

Anything outside of `data-bolt` will be left intact between page renders. You can have multiple wrappers by specifying an ID

example:

```html
<div data-bolt="some-id">...</div>
```

### Router Link

To get Bolt running on your links just add `data-bolt-link` as an attribute to any links. Bolt will handle the rest.

## ✨ Super charge Bolt

Bolt has a predefined lifecycle and emits events throughout this lifecycle. you can tap into any of them at any time.

#### 🎟 Events

- prefetch-before
- prefetch-complete
- navigate-before
  - params: `{to: string, from: string}`
- navigate-complete
  - params: `{to: string, from: string}`
- loading
- load-event
  - params: `{total: integer, complete: integer}`
- load-complete
- render-before
- render-complete

### Merge Elements

Bolt has a concept of merging static elements that are outside the main `data-bolt` wrapper. By adding `data-bolt-merge` to an element bolt will merge attributes of those elements. This is handy if you have different classes or require a specific layout between pages on elements that are static.

example:

```html
<div data-bolt-merge="div-id">...</div>
```

### Prefetch

If you want to really go after speed and have specific assets that you want to preload before a navigation event even happens you can use `data-bolt-prefetch`. This will add `preload` tags and the browser will begin preloading those assets in the background.

🚨 - This is very agressive and must be used with caution, but it can result in dramatically faster pages loads.

### API

Bolt has a very simple API that allows you the ability to control lifecycle steps.

- `BoltRouter.pause()` - Pauses execution before the next step in lifecycle
- `BoltRouter.resume()` - Resumes execution
- `BoltRouter.initialize()` - Refreshes bindings

### 🚨 Danger Zone Be Very careful with these

- `BoltRouter.lock()` - Override the lock that Bolt creates during routing ( similar to pause but blocks any new routing from happening )
- `BoltRouter.unlock()` - Unlock the override
